\section{Introduction}
The configuration file is a text file used to store the current
configuration of the Epic Lasers client. It is useful for the program
as it can reads the file and configures the program (for example the
number of samples used for the anti-aliasing). 

\section{Structure}
The config file ignores all lines that begins with a '\#' so that such
lines can be used as comments.
Otherwise, a line is interpreted and must be structured as this :
\begin{verbatim}
keyword=value
\end{verbatim}

All associations of keywords and values are exhaustively listed bellow :
\begin{itemize}
\item antialiasing=\{true,false\}
\item antialiasing-samples=\{2,4,6\}
\end{itemize}
